# Prettify
Simple chrome extension that hides unwanted posts on Facebook

Demo

Random cringy "tag your friend" post on your newsfeed.
![Alt text](/before.png?raw=true "BEFORE")


All such posts are now hidden once the extension is used!
![Alt text](/after.png?raw=true "AFTER")


TO DO:

<ol>
  <li> Recieve keywords as input through the extension so that any relevant post the user wants can be hidden. (eg: GOT spoilers etc..,). </li>

  <li> Figure out a way to extract text from images. </li>
</ol>
